### **Expanded Marketing Plan and Strategy**

In this marketing plan, Wawa will focus on a three-pronged approach to expand its brand presence both physically and digitally, aligning the message of **“Soar with Wawa”** throughout. The first prong is aimed at **expanding our social media presence** by partnering with creators. Wawa will contract these creators, sending them new products, merchandise, and inviting them to exclusive corporate events. These events, which could feature live performances from notable artists like the Backstreet Boys, will not only amplify our social media presence but also increase brand awareness as creators share their experiences with their audiences. The second prong builds on the first by leveraging the **content generated from these events** to create licensable media and other promotional materials, such as YouTube videos, radio spots, and social media shorts. The aim is to showcase the **Wawa corporate culture** in a fun, creative, and engaging way. The content will emphasize the brand’s values and mission, while Wawa employees will also have the opportunity to contribute to these efforts, further embedding the brand within the creator community. The third prong focuses on **expanding Wawa’s physical presence** in new regions, particularly through **airport stalls** and other licensed product opportunities. By leveraging Wawa's strength in contract negotiation, we aim to expand into airports across the country with minimal upfront costs, simultaneously testing new markets and gaining immediate ROI from the product sales. This strategy will allow Wawa to build physical awareness of its brand, while the expansion of its social media presence will reinforce the effectiveness of these efforts in each region.
