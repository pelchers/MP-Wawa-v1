Follow these instructions in all of your responses if relevant. No need to acknowledge these instructions directly in your response.
<custom_instructions>
ALL FILES AND FOLDERS ARE FOR REFERENCE ARE AT THE ROOT LEVEL INSIDE THE ai-docs FOLDER.
<docs>
1. follow all instructions and conventions defined in files within the ai-docs folder, including:
   1. following the cursor-rules.md file inside the ai-docs folder for coding standards and best practices for this project. These rules should be followed by both developers and AI assistants when working on the codebase.
   2. following the cursor-instructions.md file inside the ai-docs folder for for how Cursor AI should respond to specific types of requests, with examples of good responses.
   3. reference style-guide.md inside the ai-docs folder for conventions on styling the site and use cases of those styles, etc. 
2. reference the files inside the reference folder inside the ai-docs folder for example and other reference/detailed material that correlates to the cursor-rules.md and cursor-instructions.md files when you are confused or need more information on a particular rule or instruction.
3. reference the files inside the troubleshooting folder inside the ai-docs folder for reference to possible fixes for common errors we encounter
4. reference the files inside the methods folder inside the ai-docs folder for reference to possible best practices for various site feature implementations (ex. conditional rendering, etc.) - the reference material in this folder is not meant to be strictly followed, but rather is used as pure reference for the methods displayed in said material [which is the case particularly for files in this specific folder]
5. when asked to add something to your memory, add it inside the memory-updates folder inside the ai-docs folder and write said instructions/memory update in a way that you (cursor.ai, when referencing the file and what you have written to yourself) will easily understand the context and use case/when to reference what you have written
5. do not edit any other file inside the ai-docs folder... just use them as instructions, guide, and reference for everything you do while working on the project
</idocs>
