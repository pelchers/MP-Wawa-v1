That's a great approach! By passing in campaign information via campaign ID, you can easily manage multiple campaigns in the database and dynamically fetch the relevant data for each page. This allows you to reuse the same page structure while tailoring the content to the specific campaign being shown, making the site more flexible and scalable.

Here's how you can implement this approach:

---

### **1. Database Structure (Campaigns)**

You'll need to structure your database in a way that allows you to store multiple campaigns, each with its own unique `campaign_id`. This could include various campaign details like `title`, `description`, and `start_date`, along with any specific content related to the campaign (e.g., images, statistics, etc.).

Example Prisma schema for campaigns:

```prisma
model Campaign {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())  // Unique ID for each campaign
  title       String   // Campaign title
  description String   // Description of the campaign
  date        DateTime // Start date of the campaign
  type        String   // Type of campaign (e.g., product launch, seasonal sale)
  imageUrl    String?  // Optional: Image URL for the campaign
  features    String[] // List of features related to the campaign
  created_at  DateTime @default(now())  // Created date (automatically set)
}
```

In this structure, each campaign has its own `id` (a unique identifier) and all associated campaign data.

---

### **2. Fetching Campaign Data by ID**

When a user visits a page that needs to show campaign data, you can fetch the relevant campaign information using the campaign ID. You can dynamically select which campaign ID to show at the top of the page and fetch the campaign data from the database based on that ID.

For example, in your backend controller, you can fetch a campaign by ID using Prisma:

```ts
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

const getCampaignById = async (campaignId: number) => {
  return await prisma.campaign.findUnique({
    where: {
      id: campaignId,
    },
  });
};
```

This function retrieves the campaign from the database using the `campaignId` and returns the relevant data.

---

### **3. Passing Campaign ID to Frontend**

Once you fetch the campaign data in your backend, you can pass it to the frontend via an API endpoint or directly when rendering the page. If you're using a **React** frontend with a **Node.js backend**, this would look something like:

**Backend (Express) Route to Serve Campaign Data:**

```ts
import express from 'express';
import { getCampaignById } from './services/campaignService';

const app = express();

app.get('/campaign/:id', async (req, res) => {
  const campaignId = parseInt(req.params.id, 10);

  try {
    const campaign = await getCampaignById(campaignId);
    if (campaign) {
      res.json(campaign); // Send campaign data to frontend
    } else {
      res.status(404).send('Campaign not found');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).send('Error fetching campaign data');
  }
});
```

**Frontend (React Component to Fetch Campaign Data):**

In the frontend, you can fetch the campaign data using the campaign ID, which can be passed through the URL or as a prop.

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

interface Campaign {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  features: string[];
}

const CampaignPage = ({ campaignId }: { campaignId: number }) => {
  const [campaign, setCampaign] = useState<Campaign | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCampaignData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`/campaign/${campaignId}`);
        if (response.ok) {
          const data = await response.json();
          setCampaign(data);
        } else {
          console.error('Campaign not found');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching campaign data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchCampaignData();
  }, [campaignId]);

  if (!campaign) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="campaign-page">
      <section className="hero bg-blue-500 text-white p-8">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{campaign.title}</h1>
        <p>{campaign.description}</p>
        <button className="mt-4 bg-green-500 p-2 rounded">Learn More</button>
      </section>

      <section className="features p-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Key Features</h2>
        <ul className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-4">
          {campaign.features.map((feature, idx) => (
            <li key={idx} className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
              {feature}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CampaignPage;
```

In this example:
- The **`CampaignPage`** component fetches the campaign data based on the `campaignId` passed as a prop.
- The data is displayed dynamically on the page, with sections like the **Hero Section** and **Features Section**.

---

### **4. Dynamic Routing with Campaign ID**

To make this more scalable, you can set up dynamic routing in React to handle different campaign pages based on the campaign ID passed in the URL.

For example, using **React Router**:

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import CampaignPage from './CampaignPage';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/campaign/:id" element={<CampaignPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

Here, the `:id` part of the URL acts as a placeholder for the campaign ID. When the URL changes (e.g., `/campaign/1`), the corresponding campaign data will be fetched and displayed.

---

### **5. Example Use Case**

Let’s say you have multiple campaigns in your database, such as:

- Campaign 1: A new product launch
- Campaign 2: A seasonal sale
- Campaign 3: An influencer collaboration

Each campaign will have its own unique ID (`1`, `2`, `3`, etc.), and you can use dynamic routing to display the corresponding campaign by passing the campaign ID through the URL.

- `/campaign/1` will display the first campaign (new product launch).
- `/campaign/2` will display the second campaign (seasonal sale).
- `/campaign/3` will display the third campaign (influencer collaboration).

By storing campaign data in the database and fetching it by ID, your marketing site will be able to dynamically display different campaigns without the need to manually change content on each page. You just need to update the campaign details in the database, and the frontend will automatically fetch and display the new content.

---

### **Conclusion**

This approach allows you to easily manage and display multiple campaigns dynamically. Each campaign has its own data stored in the database, and the frontend fetches the relevant campaign details based on the campaign ID passed in the URL. This setup makes the site scalable and easily adaptable to any future campaigns you wish to add.

This document provides a comprehensive guide to setting up a marketing site that dynamically handles multiple campaigns based on campaign IDs. The site will use **Vite**, **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**, **ShadCN**, **Prisma**, **PostgreSQL**, and **TurboRepo**. The goal is to make the site flexible, allowing you to easily manage and display content for various marketing campaigns by selecting campaign IDs dynamically at the page level.

---

### **Project Structure Overview**

1. **Frontend Development (Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind + ShadCN)**:
   - **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server for the frontend.
   - **React**: For building a modular, dynamic user interface.
   - **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety across the project.
   - **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for easy styling and customization.
   - **ShadCN**: Reusable, customizable UI components.

2. **Backend (Minimal)**:
   - **Prisma**: ORM for interacting with PostgreSQL, storing and managing campaign-related data.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Database for storing multiple marketing campaigns and related content (e.g., campaign details, statistics).
   - **TurboRepo**: Manages the monorepo setup, allowing efficient concurrent builds of both frontend and backend.

---

### **Step-by-Step Project Setup**

#### 1. **Setting Up Vite + React + TypeScript**
   Start by creating a project using **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**:

   ```bash
   npm create vite@latest marketing-site --template react-ts
   cd marketing-site
   ```

   Install **Tailwind CSS**:

   ```bash
   npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npx tailwindcss init
   ```

   Add the following to `tailwind.config.js`:

   ```js
   module.exports = {
     content: [
       "./index.html",
       "./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
     ],
     theme: {
       extend: {},
     },
     plugins: [],
   }
   ```

   Update `src/index.css` to include Tailwind’s base styles:

   ```css
   @tailwind base;
   @tailwind components;
   @tailwind utilities;
   ```

#### 2. **Integrating ShadCN Components**
   Install **ShadCN UI** components:

   ```bash
   npm install @shadcn/ui
   ```

   Example of using a **ShadCN** component in your React files:

   ```tsx
   import { Button } from '@shadcn/ui';
   ```

#### 3. **Database Setup (PostgreSQL + Prisma)**
   Install **Prisma** and initialize the PostgreSQL database:

   ```bash
   npm install prisma @prisma/client
   npx prisma init
   ```

   Configure `schema.prisma` for PostgreSQL:

   ```prisma
   datasource db {
     provider = "postgresql"
     url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
   }
   ```

   Define the `Campaign` model to store campaign-related data:

   ```prisma
   model Campaign {
     id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())  // Unique campaign ID
     title       String   // Campaign title
     description String?  // Campaign description
     date        DateTime // Start date
     type        String   // Type of campaign (e.g., product launch, seasonal sale)
     imageUrl    String?  // Optional image URL for the campaign
     features    String[] // List of features for the campaign
     created_at  DateTime @default(now()) // Created date
   }
   ```

   This allows for multiple campaigns to be stored in the database, with each having its own unique `id`.

#### 4. **TurboRepo Setup for Efficient Builds**
   Install **TurboRepo** to efficiently manage the monorepo:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev turbo
   ```

   Set up **TurboRepo** in `turbo.json` to handle concurrent builds:

   ```json
   {
     "pipeline": {
       "dev": {
         "dependsOn": ["^dev"],
         "outputs": []
       },
       "build": {
         "dependsOn": ["^build"],
         "outputs": ["client/dist", "server/dist"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Ensure that the `client` and `server` directories are set up in your monorepo.

#### 5. **Fetching Campaign Data by ID**
   Fetch the campaign data based on the campaign ID passed in the URL or as a parameter. This ensures that the correct campaign content is displayed dynamically.

   **Backend (Express)**: A route to fetch a campaign by ID:

   ```ts
   import express from 'express';
   import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

   const prisma = new PrismaClient();
   const app = express();

   app.get('/campaign/:id', async (req, res) => {
     const campaignId = parseInt(req.params.id, 10);

     try {
       const campaign = await prisma.campaign.findUnique({
         where: { id: campaignId },
       });

       if (campaign) {
         res.json(campaign); // Send campaign data to frontend
       } else {
         res.status(404).send('Campaign not found');
       }
     } catch (error) {
       res.status(500).send('Error fetching campaign data');
     }
   });
   ```

#### 6. **Dynamic Frontend (React)**

In the **React** frontend, pass the campaign ID (from the URL) and fetch the campaign data to display dynamically.

**React Component (CampaignPage)**:

```tsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

interface Campaign {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl?: string;
  features: string[];
}

const CampaignPage = () => {
  const { id } = useParams(); // Get campaign ID from URL
  const [campaign, setCampaign] = useState<Campaign | null>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchCampaignData = async () => {
      try {
        const response = await fetch(`/campaign/${id}`);
        if (response.ok) {
          const data = await response.json();
          setCampaign(data);
        } else {
          console.error('Campaign not found');
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error fetching campaign data:', error);
      }
    };

    fetchCampaignData();
  }, [id]);

  if (!campaign) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="campaign-page">
      <section className="hero bg-blue-500 text-white p-8">
        <h1 className="text-3xl font-bold">{campaign.title}</h1>
        <p>{campaign.description}</p>
        <button className="mt-4 bg-green-500 p-2 rounded">Learn More</button>
      </section>

      <section className="features p-8">
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Key Features</h2>
        <ul className="grid grid-cols-1 sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 mt-4">
          {campaign.features.map((feature, idx) => (
            <li key={idx} className="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
              {feature}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CampaignPage;
```

This component fetches the campaign data based on the `id` from the URL (`/campaign/:id`) and dynamically displays it.

#### 7. **Dynamic Routing with React Router**

Set up **React Router** to handle dynamic routes for each campaign:

```tsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Routes } from 'react-router-dom';
import CampaignPage from './CampaignPage';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/campaign/:id" element={<CampaignPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
};
```

With this, you can now navigate to URLs like `/campaign/1`, `/campaign/2`, etc., where the campaign content is dynamically loaded based on the ID.

---

### **Content Structure for Different Marketing Campaigns**

1. **Campaign Data Models**:
   - Store campaign data in the `Campaign` table with dynamic fields such as `title`, `description`, `features`, and `imageUrl`.
   - This allows for managing and displaying multiple campaigns without manual changes to the frontend each time.

2. **Modular Content**:
   - Reusable components (e.g., hero sections, features lists, testimonials) will be dynamically populated based on the campaign data.
   - Content like campaign descriptions, features, and metrics will be updated as new campaigns are added to the database.

---

### **Marketing Plan Integration**

By storing campaigns in the database and retrieving them dynamically by ID, the site is flexible enough to display any campaign, and the content can be updated directly in the database. The frontend fetches the data based on the campaign ID, ensuring seamless and scalable content presentation.

---

### **Conclusion**

This setup ensures that your marketing site can display any campaign dynamically by passing a campaign ID to the URL. The backend fetches the campaign data from the database and the frontend renders it on the page, making it easy to manage multiple campaigns without manual content changes.

This approach makes the site highly scalable and adaptable to any marketing plan you want to implement in the future.
